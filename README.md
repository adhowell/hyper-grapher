This is a project for testing rendering methods of fairly large directional hyper-graphs in Qt/C++

Stuff:
- [x] Multiple edge rendering modes
- [ ] Layout algorithms
- [ ] Graph and hyper-graph file format parsers
- [ ] Node / edge attributes
- [ ] Hierarchy
- [ ] Improved multi-threading
- [ ] GPU acceleration
